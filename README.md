# opensearch-mcp

Zero-config web search and fetch MCP with free-tier-first routing across official providers

## Tools

- **`web_search`** — Multi-engine web search with quality-first routing. It uses configured free-tier/API providers first, then falls back through Brave, hosted Parallel MCP, hosted Exa MCP, optional Exa API, optional Kagi/Mojeek/SearxNG, keyless public providers, DuckDuckGo, and an augmented Bing fallback. Responses are text-first and render the full result set in `content`.
- **`web_fetch`** — Fetches one or more URLs and converts them to markdown. It accepts Exa-style `urls`. Responses are text-first: each `content` block includes source metadata followed by extracted markdown. It tries Exa's hosted MCP fetch path first, then TinyFish when `TINYFISH_API_KEY` is configured, then Exa's official contents API when `EXA_API_KEY` is configured, then the local HTML/PDF pipeline and finally [Jina AI](https://jina.ai) for sparse content.

## Usage

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "opensearch": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "opensearch-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

Or with a specific version:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "opensearch": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "opensearch-mcp@latest"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Library Usage

The reusable search and fetch runtime is published as `@minpeter/opensearch`.
The MCP package is a stdio wrapper around this library, so no-key routing,
free-tier-first provider order, fetch extraction, retry, and cache behavior live
in the library.

```ts
import {
  fetchUrlsWithCache,
  searchWithRetryAndCache,
} from "@minpeter/opensearch";

const results = await searchWithRetryAndCache("TypeScript release notes", 5);
const pages = await fetchUrlsWithCache(results.slice(0, 2).map((result) => result.url));
```

| Provider | Path used by this server | Credential needed here? | Notes |
|---|---|---:|---|
| TinyFish | TinyFish Search API | Yes | Requires `TINYFISH_API_KEY`; semicolon-delimited key pools are supported for HTTP 429 retry rotation. |
| Tavily | Tavily Search API | Yes | Requires `TAVILY_API_KEY`; semicolon-delimited key pools are tried in order. |
| Firecrawl | Firecrawl Search API | Yes | Requires `FIRECRAWL_API_KEY`. |
| Parallel | Parallel Search API | Yes | Requires `PARALLEL_API_KEY`; uses the current `/v1/search` endpoint and excerpt response shape. |
| Parallel | Parallel hosted MCP (`https://search.parallel.ai/mcp`) | No | Enabled by default unless `OPENSEARCH_ENABLE_PARALLEL_MCP=false`; if `PARALLEL_API_KEY` is present it is also sent as a Bearer token for higher limits. |
| You.com | You.com Search API | Yes | Requires `YOU_API_KEY`. |
| Perplexity | Perplexity Search API | Yes | Requires `PERPLEXITY_API_KEY`. |
| Serper | Google SERP API | Yes | Requires `SERPER_API_KEY`. |
| SerpAPI | Multi-engine SERP API | Yes | Requires `SERPAPI_API_KEY`. |
| DataForSEO | Google Organic SERP API | Yes | Requires `DATAFORSEO_LOGIN` and `DATAFORSEO_PASSWORD`. |
| Google CSE | Google Custom Search JSON API | Yes | Requires `GOOGLE_CUSTOM_SEARCH_API_KEY` and `GOOGLE_CUSTOM_SEARCH_ENGINE_ID`; available only to existing Custom Search JSON API customers. |
| Kagi | Kagi Search API | Yes | Requires `KAGI_API_KEY` or `KAGI_API_TOKEN`. |
| Mojeek | Mojeek Search API | Yes | Requires `MOJEEK_API_KEY`. |
| Bright Data | SERP API request endpoint | Yes | Requires `BRIGHT_DATA_SERP_API_KEY` and `BRIGHT_DATA_SERP_ZONE`; set `OPENSEARCH_BRIGHT_DATA_SERP_URL` only for a trusted custom gateway. |
| ScrapingBee | Google store SERP endpoint | Yes | Requires `SCRAPINGBEE_API_KEY`. |
| SearchAPI.io | SearchAPI Google SERP endpoint | Yes | Requires `SEARCHAPI_API_KEY`. |
| Valyu | Valyu Search API | Yes | Requires `VALYU_API_KEY`; uses `https://api.valyu.ai/v1/search`. |
| Linkup | Linkup Search API | Yes | Requires `LINKUP_API_KEY`. |
| Jina Search | Jina Search API (`https://s.jina.ai/<query>`) | Yes | Requires `JINA_API_KEY`; current Jina rate limits block unauthenticated search, while `web_fetch` still uses Jina Reader as a no-token sparse-content fallback. |
| Brave | Brave Search API | Yes | Requires `BRAVE_SEARCH_API_KEY`. |
| Exa | Exa hosted MCP (`https://mcp.exa.ai/mcp`) | No (free hosted plan) | Tried first unless `OPENSEARCH_ENABLE_EXA_MCP=false`. |
| Exa | Exa Search API | Yes | Used after hosted MCP when `EXA_API_KEY` is set. |
| SearxNG | JSON Search API | No | Set `OPENSEARCH_SEARXNG_URLS` to one or more public/self-hosted instances separated by semicolons. |
| Startpage | Public search page scraping | No | Keyless Google-proxy fallback; enabled by default unless `OPENSEARCH_ENABLE_ZERO_KEY_PROVIDERS=false`. |
| Webcrawler | Public metasearch page scraping | No | Keyless Google/Bing metasearch fallback. |
| Wikipedia | Public MediaWiki search API | No | Used only as a parallel supplement inside the augmented Bing fallback, not as a standalone general-search provider. |
| Internet Archive | Public Advanced Search API | No | Used only as a parallel supplement inside the augmented Bing fallback for historical/public collection matches. |
| Wiby | Public small-web search page scraping | No | Used only as a parallel supplement inside the augmented Bing fallback. |
| DuckDuckGo | HTML scraping | No | Public HTML endpoint; can still hit anti-bot challenges. |
| Bing | HTML scraping plus parallel supplements | No | Final keyless general fallback; fetches Bing, Wikipedia, Internet Archive, and Wiby in parallel, then returns Bing-first merged results. |

This project intentionally aggregates only official API paths, official hosted MCP paths, or public web pages. It does not rely on reverse-engineered private endpoints or credential bypasses.

#### Free coverage

Provider limits change, so treat this as a snapshot verified on 2026-06-07 and check the linked official pages before committing production capacity.

| Tier | Works without tokens? | Practical ceiling |
|---|---:|---|
| Default install | Yes | Hosted [Parallel Search MCP](https://docs.parallel.ai/integrations/mcp/search-mcp) and hosted [Exa MCP](https://exa.ai/docs/changelog/february-2026-api-updates) are enabled by default; Parallel supports anonymous lower-rate-limit MCP calls, and Exa unauthenticated MCP users get 150 calls/day at 3 QPS. Local `web_fetch` extraction also runs without a token. If upstream providers fail, `web_search` can still try Startpage, Webcrawler, DuckDuckGo, and augmented Bing. |
| SearxNG | Yes, with URL config | Add one or more public or self-hosted instances in `OPENSEARCH_SEARXNG_URLS`; no API key is sent. [SearxNG JSON output](https://docs.searxng.org/dev/search_api.html) must be enabled by the instance, and many public instances disable it or rate-limit it. |
| Zero-key public providers | Yes | Startpage and Webcrawler are standalone keyless providers. Wikipedia, Internet Archive, and Wiby are not standalone general-search fallbacks; they run in parallel only inside augmented Bing. Public HTML pages can change markup or rate-limit traffic, so these sit after hosted MCP/API-quality providers. |
| Parallel hosted MCP | Yes | [Parallel Search MCP](https://docs.parallel.ai/integrations/mcp/search-mcp) documents `https://search.parallel.ai/mcp` as free to use anonymously at lower rate limits; set `PARALLEL_API_KEY` only when you want higher limits. |
| Brave | Key required, monthly free credit | [Brave Search API](https://brave.com/search/api/) lists $5 in free monthly credits; Search is $5 per 1,000 requests. |
| Tavily | Key required, free monthly credits | [Tavily](https://docs.tavily.com/documentation/api-credits) lists 1,000 API credits/month with no credit card; basic search costs 1 credit. |
| Firecrawl | Key required, free monthly credits | [Firecrawl](https://www.firecrawl.dev/pricing) lists 1,000 credits/month; Search costs 2 credits per 10 results. |
| Serper | Key required, free starter queries | [Serper](https://serper.dev/) advertises 2,500 free queries with no credit card. |
| Google Custom Search JSON API | Key and engine ID required | [Google](https://developers.google.com/custom-search/v1/overview) lists 100 free queries/day for existing customers, but the API is closed to new customers and existing customers have until January 1, 2027 to transition. |
| SerpAPI | Key required, free monthly searches | [SerpAPI](https://serpapi.com/pricing) lists 250 searches/month on the free plan. |
| You.com | Key required, free credit | [You.com](https://about.you.com/pricing) lists $100 starting credit; Search is $5 per 1,000 calls. |
| Exa Search API | Key required, free monthly requests | [Exa](https://exa.ai/pricing?tab=api) lists 1,000 requests/month for free; Search is $7 per 1,000 requests after that. |
| DataForSEO | Account credentials required | [DataForSEO](https://dataforseo.com/apis/serp-api/pricing) lists $1 registration credit; pricing depends on retrieval mode and parameters. This server defaults to the live Google Organic endpoint, so check the current calculator before budgeting. |
| Parallel Search API | Key required, paid current listing | [Parallel](https://docs.parallel.ai/getting-started/pricing) lists the raw Search API at $5 per 1,000 requests; use hosted MCP for the no-key path. |
| Perplexity | Key required, paid current listing | [Perplexity](https://docs.perplexity.ai/getting-started/pricing) lists Search API at $5 per 1,000 requests; no always-free public API quota is documented there. |
| Jina Search | Key required, free API key quota | [Jina Reader API](https://jina.ai/en-US/reader/) currently lists `https://s.jina.ai` as blocked without an API key and 100 RPM with a free API key. |

Retired provider paths are intentionally not routed. `BING_SEARCH_API_KEY`, `OPENSEARCH_BING_API_URL`, `OPENSEARCH_ENABLE_GOOGLE_SCRAPE`, `NAVER_CLIENT_ID`, `NAVER_CLIENT_SECRET`, and `OPENSEARCH_NAVER_URL` no longer add search providers.

The fallback chain is:

1. TinyFish when `TINYFISH_API_KEY` is configured.
2. LLM-native providers: Tavily, Firecrawl, Parallel API, You.com, Perplexity, Valyu, Linkup, Jina.
3. SERP/official providers: Serper, SerpAPI, DataForSEO, Google Custom Search, Bright Data, ScrapingBee, SearchAPI.io.
4. Brave Search API when configured.
5. Hosted MCP providers: Parallel, then Exa.
6. Exa Search API when configured.
7. Independent providers: Kagi, Mojeek, SearxNG.
8. Keyless public providers: Startpage, Webcrawler.
9. DuckDuckGo public page fallback.
10. Augmented Bing fallback: Bing, Wikipedia, Internet Archive, and Wiby run in parallel; results are deduped and returned Bing-first.

Set `OPENSEARCH_ENABLE_PARALLEL_MCP=false`, `OPENSEARCH_ENABLE_EXA_MCP=false`, or `OPENSEARCH_ENABLE_ZERO_KEY_PROVIDERS=false` to skip those fallback groups. If a configured provider returns malformed data, no results, auth failures, or rate limits, the server continues down the fallback chain instead of aborting the search.

Returns a compact text rendering of the full result set in `content`, with each result rendered in `Title` / `URL` / `Highlights` / `Source` form.

#### Optional endpoint overrides

Most API providers also support endpoint override environment variables for tests, private gateways, or enterprise-specific URLs:

`OPENSEARCH_TAVILY_URL`, `OPENSEARCH_FIRECRAWL_URL`, `OPENSEARCH_PARALLEL_URL`, `OPENSEARCH_YOU_URL`, `OPENSEARCH_PERPLEXITY_URL`, `OPENSEARCH_SERPER_URL`, `OPENSEARCH_SERPAPI_URL`, `OPENSEARCH_DATAFORSEO_URL`, `OPENSEARCH_GOOGLE_CSE_URL`, `OPENSEARCH_KAGI_URL`, `OPENSEARCH_MOJEEK_URL`, `OPENSEARCH_BRIGHT_DATA_SERP_URL`, `OPENSEARCH_SCRAPINGBEE_URL`, `OPENSEARCH_SEARCHAPI_URL`, `OPENSEARCH_VALYU_URL`, `OPENSEARCH_LINKUP_URL`, `OPENSEARCH_JINA_SEARCH_URL`, `OPENSEARCH_STARTPAGE_URL`, `OPENSEARCH_WEBCRAWLER_URL`, `OPENSEARCH_WIKIPEDIA_URL`, `OPENSEARCH_INTERNET_ARCHIVE_URL`, and `OPENSEARCH_WIBY_URL`.

Credentialed endpoint overrides must use HTTPS. Plain HTTP is accepted only for `localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, or `::1` test servers.

#### Reviewed but not routed

The zero-key audit also checked Dogpile, Info.com, ZapMeta, Search.com, Million Short, Teclis, Search Encrypt, Ghostery Private Search, Disconnect Search, Brave public HTML, Ecosia, Swisscows, MetaGer, Qwant, Marginalia, Whoogle/LibreX public instances, Yandex, Baidu, Yahoo, Ask.com, Yippy, Gigablast, Common Crawl, and Naver scrape candidates. They are not routed by default because the live public paths were blocked by captcha/login flows, closed beta pages, dead endpoints, unstable redirects, non-real-time index semantics, or markup that did not expose reliable result records during verification. Naver is intentionally excluded.

### `web_fetch`

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `urls` | string[] | URLs to fetch in one call |

For non-disabled hosted MCP mode, `web_fetch` tries Exa's official hosted MCP fetch path first so it can use the hosted free tier. If that is unavailable and `TINYFISH_API_KEY` is configured, it falls back to TinyFish's fetch API before trying Exa's official `POST /contents` API, the local Readability/PDF pipeline, and Jina for sparse content. `TINYFISH_API_KEY` may contain a single key or a semicolon-delimited key pool; HTTP 429 responses rotate to the next configured key before falling back.

Single-fetch calls return one text block in `content` with `Title`, `URL`, `Length`, and the extracted markdown. Batch-fetch calls return a short summary block plus one text block per fetched URL with the same metadata-first format.
