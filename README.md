# opensearch

Web search and page fetch for agents and TypeScript apps.

## Packages

[`@minpeter/opensearch`](packages/opensearch/README.md) is the core runtime for
search, fetch, routing, and page extraction.

[`opensearch-mcp`](packages/opensearch-mcp/README.md) ships `web_search` and
`web_fetch` as MCP stdio tools.

[`opensearch-ai-sdk`](packages/opensearch-ai-sdk/README.md) wraps the same
search and fetch surface for the Vercel AI SDK.
